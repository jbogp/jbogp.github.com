##The curse of mutlidisciplinarity (when you need a visa)

I'm 27 now and I've always liked complex stuff, even as a kid I've always been pretty good as untangling tangled stuff. When I turned 13 I read books that my dad had cleverly placed on my shelf without trying to force me into reading them (otherwise I probably never would have) the O'Reilley's HTML, Javascript and PHP bibles. Thinking back that's actually how I learnt most of my English too...

Anyway, I fell in love with computer science, but at 18 when I got my Baccalaureat (the French equivalent of graduating high school) I wasn't ready to say _"yep this is it, that's what I'm gonna do for a living"_. I mean, why would you want to stop learning about biology for instance, that shit's great.

Long story short, I never really was able to decide what I wanted to specialize into, that's the curse of being too curious. **By always feeling unsatisfied not to have really studied this or that, I'm now the proud owner of a Ms's in bioengineering, another Ms's in CS and a PhD in statistics** ([my full CV](http://jbogp.github.io/JBP_Resume_2015.pdf) in case you're curious). I didn't really think this through during my studies but it turns out having a very diverse background like this is really fashionable nowadays. Good for me, and as far as I've tried I haven't struggled one bit finding jobs in Europe, so how does this turn into a curse when you need a work visa in the US?

I came looking for a job in the Silicone Valley (through the amazing "Insight Data Engineering program") and things were good, got invited for interviews at a lot of great companies big and small but here's the catch.

- At big companies things are compartmented a lot, so that's what happens, I get called back for interviews at a particular position (data science, data engineer or software engineer usually) but it turns out I'm not as good in statistics or coding as someone who has its entire background in the same field (bachelor, Ms and PhD in stats for instance), add this to the fact that even though they do sponsor a lot of H1-B visas, from the own admission of the recruiter at one of these big companies, when you need a visa and cannot start working before at least 6 months, you don't need to be better than every other candidate interviewing for the position, you need to be WAY better.

- Ok, so big companies are too big for me to really express my mutlidisciplinary background, it's ok I'll just go for smaller ones I've always enjoyed not feeling like a replaceable gear in a complex machine anyway. With fewer employees you'd think people would appreciate the fact that you can grasp a large part of the business model and be productive in various positions depending upon the current company's needs. Well that may be true but I'll never now, maybe I got really unlucky but with smaller companies, things went:
  - Oh we're really excited about your background and skills
  - Cool, I'm really excited about what you guys do
  - Oh by the way do you have a work visa and when can you start?
  - No sorry I need to be sponsored, so I can't start working before at least 6 months, but probably a year
  - Oh. Well, we need someone now, sorry, but if you get a work visa from another company please reach back to us, we'd love to hear from you !

So there you have it, of course I haven't interviewed with every company out there, but my ESTA temporary visa was expiring so got back to France. Too bad California, I actually liked you.
